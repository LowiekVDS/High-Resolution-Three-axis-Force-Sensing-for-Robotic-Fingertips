# High Resolution Three-axis Force Sensing for Robotic Fingertips

This is the GitHub repository related to my masters disseration. It contains the CAD and software used

## Overview
- CAD: contains mechanical CAD data from Siemens NX and .obj files
- data: some .csv files recored using the procedure described in the dissertation
- electrical: EasyEDA files
- models: trained models for my prototype
- notebooks: contains code for calibration,readout, plotting and model creation
- plotjuggler: preset for PlotJuggler stuff
- sensor-readout: A Platform IO project for the microcontroller reading out the sensor array
